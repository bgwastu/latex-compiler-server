\begin{abstract}
This report presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of Meta and TikTok's advertising revenue, market share, and growth dynamics for 2023 and 2024. Drawing on verified financial disclosures, industry reports, and market research, we examine revenue figures, growth rates, user engagement metrics, and regulatory influences shaping the digital advertising ecosystem. Meta's dominant market position and robust revenue growth are contrasted with TikTok's rapid expansion and regulatory headwinds, providing actionable insights for advertisers, analysts, and stakeholders.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

The digital advertising landscape in 2023 and 2024 was marked by rapid growth, evolving user engagement, and intensifying regulatory scrutiny. Meta Platforms, Inc. (formerly Facebook Inc.) maintained its position as a global leader, leveraging its Family of Apps to generate the majority of its revenue from advertising. TikTok, owned by ByteDance, emerged as a formidable competitor, particularly among younger demographics, with innovative ad formats and high engagement. This report synthesizes data on advertising revenues, growth rates, market shares, and influencing factors for Meta and TikTok, providing a detailed comparative analysis and outlook for the sector.

\section{Advertising Revenue Figures and Growth Rates}

\subsection{Annual Revenue and Growth}

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Advertising Revenue and Growth (2023--2024)}
\label{tab:ad_revenue_growth}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l S[table-format=3.2] S[table-format=3.2] S[table-format=2.1]}
\toprule
Company & {2023 Revenue (USD B)} & {2024 Revenue (USD B)} & {YoY Growth (\%)} \\
\midrule
Meta   & 131.95 & 160.63 & 21.7 \\
TikTok & 18.00  & 23.60  & 30.7 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

Meta's advertising revenue increased from \$131.95 billion in 2023 to \$160.63 billion in 2024, a 21.7\% increase, driven by higher ad impressions and increased average price per ad \cite{meta_oberlo,meta_ycharts,meta_q4_2024}. TikTok's ad revenue grew from approximately \$18 billion in 2023 to \$23.6 billion in 2024, a 30.7\% increase, reflecting rapid monetization and user base expansion \cite{tiktok_oberlo,tiktok_sendshort}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Quarterly Growth Trends}

Meta's Q4 2023 advertising revenue reached \$38.7 billion, a 23.8\% year-over-year increase \cite{meta_q4_2023,meta_searchengineland}. TikTok's U.S. ad revenue also saw strong growth, but with volatility due to regulatory uncertainty \cite{tiktok_statista_us,tiktok_roirevolution}.

\section{Market Share and Geographic Distribution}

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Digital Ad Market Share (\%) by Company and Geography}
\label{tab:market_share}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l S[table-format=2.1] S[table-format=2.1] S[table-format=2.1] S[table-format=2.1]}
\toprule
Year & {Meta Global} & {TikTok Global} & {Meta US} & {TikTok US} \\
\midrule
2023 & 18.0 & 3.0 & 21.1 & 3.4 \\
2024 & 18.5 & 4.0 & 21.1 & 3.4 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

Meta held approximately 18\% of the global digital advertising market in 2023, second only to Google, and about 21.1\% of the U.S. digital ad market \cite{statista_global_share,statista_us_share}. TikTok's global share was about 3\% in 2023, growing to an estimated 4\% in 2024, with a notable but volatile presence in the U.S. market \cite{tiktok_roirevolution,martech_meta_tiktok}.

\section{User Engagement and Advertising Metrics}

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{User Engagement and Advertising Metrics (2024)}
\label{tab:user_metrics}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l X X}
\toprule
Metric & Meta & TikTok \\
\midrule
Monthly Active Users (MAU) & 4 billion (Family of Apps) & 1.6 billion \\
Daily Active People (DAP) & 3.35 billion & $\sim$1 billion (estimated) \\
Average Daily Time Spent & Not explicitly stated & 54 min (US), 58 min (global) \\
Average Price per Ad Growth & +10\% & Lower CPM than Meta \\
Ad Formats & Image, video, carousel, stories, Reels & In-feed video, TopView, Branded Hashtags, Spark Ads \\
Advertiser Base & 10 million active advertisers & 7.5 million US businesses \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

Meta's Family of Apps reached 4 billion MAU and 3.35 billion DAP by December 2024, with ad impressions growing 11\% year-over-year and average price per ad increasing 10\% \cite{meta_q4_2024}. TikTok's user base grew to 1.6 billion MAU globally, with U.S. users spending an average of 54 minutes daily on the app \cite{tiktok_sendshort}.

\section{Influencing Trends and Regulatory Factors}

\subsection{Meta}

Meta's growth is driven by AI integration in ad targeting, expansion into new platforms like Threads, and steady user engagement. However, it faces challenges from demographic shifts and regulatory pressures, especially in Europe \cite{meta_q4_2024,meta_yahoo,meta_dsa}.

\subsection{TikTok}

TikTok's rapid growth is fueled by younger demographics, viral content, and social commerce. Regulatory uncertainty in the U.S., including potential bans and forced divestitures, poses significant risks, especially as the U.S. accounts for nearly half of its global ad revenue \cite{tiktok_economic_impact,cb_tiktok_ban,martech_meta_tiktok}.

\subsection{Regulatory Events}

The January 2025 TikTok outage in the U.S. led to a 10\% increase in Meta's CPM, highlighting Meta's dominance and TikTok's role as a lower-cost alternative for smaller advertisers \cite{cb_tiktok_ban}. Both companies are contesting the EU Digital Services Act fees, reflecting ongoing regulatory tensions \cite{meta_dsa}.

\section{Comparative Analysis}

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Meta vs. TikTok: Comparative Metrics (2023--2024)}
\label{tab:comparative}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l X X}
\toprule
Aspect & Meta & TikTok \\
\midrule
Advertising Revenue (2024) & \$160.63B (+21.7\% YoY) & \$23.6B (+30.7\% YoY) \\
Market Share (Global 2023) & 18\% & 3\% \\
Market Share (US 2024) & 21.1\% & 3.4\% (declined in Q4) \\
User Base (MAU) & 4B (Family of Apps) & 1.6B \\
Average Daily Time Spent & Not stated & 54 min (US) \\
Ad Formats & Diverse: image, video, carousel, stories, Reels & Video-centric: in-feed, TopView, branded effects \\
Average CPM & Higher; increased 10\% in 2024 & Lower; about half of Meta's CPM in Q1 2024 \\
Regulatory Risks & Moderate; EU and US privacy laws & High; US potential ban/divestiture \\
Growth Drivers & AI, new platforms (Threads), mature user base & Viral content, social commerce, younger demographics \\
Advertiser Base & 10M active advertisers & 7.5M US businesses \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\section{Discussion}

Meta's advertising revenue growth is underpinned by its massive user base, advanced targeting, and diversified ad formats. Its resilience is evident in robust financials and continued investments in AI and infrastructure \cite{meta_oberlo,meta_ycharts,meta_q4_2024}. TikTok, while smaller in absolute revenue, is growing rapidly, especially among younger users and in social commerce. However, regulatory risks, particularly in the U.S., threaten its future growth and market share \cite{tiktok_oberlo,tiktok_sendshort,cb_tiktok_ban}.

\section{Conclusions and Future Outlook}

Meta remains the dominant global digital advertising platform, with strong revenue growth and a diversified product ecosystem. Its strategic investments in AI and new platforms position it for continued expansion, though regulatory and demographic challenges persist. TikTok's explosive growth highlights its rising importance, but its future is clouded by significant regulatory risks, especially in the U.S. The digital advertising market is increasingly concentrated, with Meta and Google controlling over 50\% of global revenues. TikTok's rapid growth challenges this duopoly but is vulnerable to geopolitical and regulatory headwinds. Advertisers are diversifying spend, but Meta's scale and targeting continue to attract the majority of budgets. The potential redistribution of TikTok's U.S. ad revenue to Meta and others could further consolidate market power and increase advertising costs, particularly impacting smaller advertisers \cite{martech_meta_tiktok,cb_tiktok_ban}.
