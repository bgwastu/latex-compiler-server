\section{Introduction}

China's electric vehicle (EV) market has undergone rapid transformation from 2020 to 2024, driven by robust government policies, technological innovation, and shifting consumer preferences. The Chinese government invested over \$230 billion in subsidies, tax breaks, and infrastructure development from 2009 through 2023, fostering a robust domestic EV industry and making China the world's largest EV market by volume \citep{techreview2023,csis2024}. Tesla entered the Chinese market in 2020 with its Shanghai Gigafactory, quickly becoming a major player due to local production and strong brand appeal. Meanwhile, BYD, a domestic manufacturer with roots in battery production, leveraged government support and vertical integration to expand aggressively. By 2024, BYD had surpassed Tesla in total EV sales in China, reflecting a broader trend of domestic brands gaining dominance in the new energy vehicle (NEV) market \citep{sciencedirect2023,reuters2025}.

\section{Government Policy, Subsidies, and Infrastructure}

China's government has played a pivotal role in shaping the EV market through a combination of direct subsidies, tax incentives, infrastructure investment, and regulatory support. From 2009 to 2023, over \$230 billion was invested in the sector, supporting both domestic and foreign manufacturers \citep{csis2024,techreview2023}. Key policy measures included:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Purchase subsidies:} Phased out by end 2022, but critical in early market expansion.
    \item \textbf{Tax exemptions and license plate priority:} Lowered barriers for consumers.
    \item \textbf{Charging infrastructure:} Over 12.8 million charging points by 2024, a 49\% YoY increase \citep{argus2024}.
    \item \textbf{Industrial policy:} Support for battery supply chains, local production, and export incentives.
\end{itemize}

These policies have enabled rapid innovation, cost reduction, and market penetration for domestic brands like BYD, while also supporting Tesla's localized production and sales growth \citep{techreview2023,sciencedirect2024,csis2024}.

\section{Conclusions and Future Outlook}

The period from 2020 to 2024 saw BYD emerge as the dominant EV manufacturer in China, surpassing Tesla in sales volume, market share, and revenue. BYD's success is underpinned by strong government support, vertical integration, aggressive pricing, rapid product development, and expanding international presence. Tesla, while maintaining a strong foothold in the premium segment and leading in technological innovation, faces increasing competitive pressure from BYD and other domestic manufacturers, especially as BYD's fast-charging technology and ADAS offerings gain traction \citep{cnn2025,investors2024,reuters2025}.

Looking ahead, China's EV market is expected to continue growing robustly, with NEVs projected to exceed 50\% of passenger car sales by 2025 \citep{techinasia2025}. BYD's expansion into international markets and continued innovation in battery and charging technologies position it well for sustained growth. Tesla's future success in China will depend on its ability to diversify its product lineup, reduce prices, and enhance local market adaptation amid intensifying competition and regulatory challenges \citep{techinasia2025,argus2024}.

Both companies face external challenges, including tariffs, geopolitical tensions, and evolving consumer preferences. The Chinese government's continued support for EV infrastructure and industrial policy will remain a critical factor shaping the competitive landscape. The ongoing price war initiated by BYD may pressure industry profitability but also accelerates consumer adoption and market penetration \citep{onglobal2025}.

\begin{quote}
``BYD's rapid innovation, aggressive pricing, and vertical integration have allowed it to dominate China and expand globally, while Tesla's slower adaptation and premium focus have led to market share erosion in China'' \citep{restofworld2025}.
