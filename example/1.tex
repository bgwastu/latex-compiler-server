\section{Introduction}

China has emerged as the world's largest and fastest-growing electric vehicle market, accounting for over 60\% of global EV sales by 2024 \citep{time2024}. The Chinese government's robust policy support---including subsidies, license plate incentives, and cash-for-clunkers programs---has accelerated EV adoption and production. Tesla entered the Chinese market in 2020 with its Shanghai Gigafactory, quickly gaining traction due to its premium battery electric vehicle (BEV) offerings and strong brand appeal \citep{sciencedirect2023}.

BYD, originally a battery manufacturer, aggressively transitioned from internal combustion engine vehicles to new energy vehicles (NEVs), including both BEVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Leveraging vertical integration, cost efficiencies, and a broad product portfolio, BYD rapidly expanded its market share domestically and internationally \citep{techresearchonline2024, statista2024}. This report examines the evolution of Tesla and BYD's competitive positions in China from 2020 to 2024, focusing on market share, sales volumes, strategic events, and financial performance.

\end{figure}

BYD's global sales more than doubled from 2020 to 2024, with a 41.3\% increase in 2024 alone, driven by PHEV growth of over 70\% \citep{bestcars2024}. Tesla's global BEV sales peaked in 2023 at about 1.85 million units but declined slightly in 2024 to 1.79 million units \citep{insideevs2024}. In 2024, BYD surpassed Tesla in total EV production, producing 1,777,965 EVs compared to Tesla's 1,774,442 units, marking a pivotal shift in global EV manufacturing leadership \citep{statista2024}.

\section{Significant Trends and Events Affecting Market Positions}

\subsection{BYD's Strategic Focus and Expansion}

BYD's aggressive expansion in PHEVs, which accounted for over half of its 2024 sales, allowed it to capture a broader consumer base, especially in China where hybrids gained market share from 33.3\% in 2023 to 43.4\% in 2024 \citep{autovista2025, tridens2025}. BYD's pricing strategy, with models starting at around \$10,000, and technological innovations such as the Blade Battery and ultra-fast charging (5 minutes for 400 km), have been key differentiators \citep{scmp2024, cnn2025}.

\subsection{Tesla's Regulatory and Competitive Challenges}

Tesla faced regulatory delays for its Full Self-Driving (FSD) system in China, limiting its competitive edge in autonomous driving features. Its limited model lineup and higher price points constrained market share growth amid rising competition from domestic brands \citep{cnn2025, investors2025}. Tesla's market share declined from 7--8\% in 2021--2022 to about 6.1\% in 2024, despite record sales volumes \citep{cnevpost2025}.

\subsection{Price War and Market Dynamics}

In 2025, BYD launched a price war in China, offering 10--30\% discounts on EVs, leveraging its vertical integration and cost advantages. Tesla responded with price adjustments but struggled to match BYD's breadth and pricing flexibility \citep{investors2025}.

\subsection{Government Policy Impacts}

China's NEV subsidies (2020--2022), license plate advantages, and cash-for-clunkers programs favored BYD's growth. Conversely, U.S. policies like the Inflation Reduction Act (2022) favored Tesla's domestic production but limited BYD's U.S. market access due to tariffs and import restrictions \citep{techresearchonline2024, ielp2024}.

\section{Financial Performance Comparison (2024)}

\begin{table}[ht]

\end{table}

BYD's strategy centers on product diversity, affordability, and rapid innovation, enabling it to capture a broad market segment. Tesla, while maintaining a technological edge in autonomy and battery technology, faces challenges in model variety and pricing competitiveness in China \citep{teslarati2025, scmp2024, cnn2025}.

\section{Discussion: Key Drivers and Policy Implications}

\subsection{Product and Technology Innovation}

BYD's introduction of the Blade Battery, ultra-fast charging, and advanced driver-assistance systems at no extra cost have been critical in attracting Chinese consumers \citep{cnn2025, scmp2024}. Tesla's FSD and 4680 battery cells remain technological benchmarks, but regulatory delays and higher costs have limited their impact in China \citep{investors2025}.

\subsection{Government Policy and Market Access}

Chinese government support, including over \$230 billion in subsidies, has been instrumental in BYD's rise \citep{time2024}. U.S. tariffs and the Inflation Reduction Act have constrained BYD's access to the U.S. market, while Tesla has benefited from U.S. policy but faces headwinds in China \citep{ielp2024, techresearchonline2024}.

\subsection{Consumer Reception and Brand Dynamics}

BYD's broad product range and affordability have resonated with Chinese consumers, while Tesla's brand preference declined from 22\% to 18\% among Chinese buyers between 2023 and 2024 \citep{scmp2024}. BYD's ability to capitalize on Tesla's political controversies and shifting consumer sentiment has further strengthened its position.

\section{Conclusions and Future Outlook}

BYD's rapid ascent in the Chinese EV market from 2020 to 2024 reflects a strategic combination of diversified product offerings, aggressive pricing, vertical integration, and alignment with government policies. Its dominance in both BEV and PHEV segments, coupled with technological innovations, has enabled BYD to surpass Tesla in market share and sales volume in China by 2024 \citep{cnn2025, statista2024}.

Tesla remains a formidable competitor with a strong global brand and technological leadership, but faces challenges in China due to regulatory delays, limited model variety, and pricing pressures \citep{investors2025, cnevpost2025}. Looking ahead, BYD is expected to continue expanding its market share in China and internationally, supported by new manufacturing plants and ongoing product innovation \citep{investors2025, gasgoo2024}. Tesla's plans to introduce more affordable models and expand autonomous services may help regain momentum, but it faces stiff competition from BYD and other Chinese manufacturers \citep{teslarati2025}.

The evolution of China's EV market underscores the importance of product diversity, pricing strategy, and government policy alignment. BYD's rise challenges Tesla's global leadership and signals a broader shift toward Chinese dominance in the EV industry, with implications for global supply chains, technology development, and competitive strategies.
